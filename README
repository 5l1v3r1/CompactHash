Compact Hash Algorithms for Computational Meshes: Data from Neighbors 2D Testbed 

This code is a set of hash functions applied to a sample mesh. It supports the paper "Compact Hash Algorithms for Computational Meshes," submitted to the SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing.

On a machine with at least one OpenCL compliant device:

Enter the 'parallel_hash' directory
run:
   ./configure
   make 
   ./neigh2d -o <trial options>

On Mac OSx install gnu-indent. The Mac version does not recognize some of the options that are used.

'./neigh2d -h' gives further information on option keywords.

The -t option refers to threshold for refinement of cells. Cells are randomly refined and a lower threshold means fewer will be refined. The default value is 2 and that was what was used in our trials.

The keywords for corresponding options are as follows:

br    Brute
kd    kdtree
hc    Hash CPU
hlc   Hash Lib CPU
hc1   Hash CPU 1
hlc1  Hash Lib CPU 1
hc2   Hash CPU 2
hlc2  Hash Lib CPU 2
hc3   Hash CPU 3
hlc3  Hash Lib CPU 3
holc3 Hash OldLib CPU 3
hg    Hash GPU
hg1   Hash GPU 1
hg2   Hash GPU 2
hg3   Hash GPU 3
hlg   Hash Lib GPU
hlg1  Hash Lib GPU 1
hlg2  Hash Lib GPU 2
hlg3  Hash Lib GPU 3
holg3 Hash OldLib GPU 3

Output file features:

Hardware detection report - an overview of the CL devices and their information
Local work size - the size of the workgroup size
Size - side length of mesh at coarsest level 
ncells - total number of cells, accounting for refined cells
compression - The number of possible cells at most refined level/ncells
